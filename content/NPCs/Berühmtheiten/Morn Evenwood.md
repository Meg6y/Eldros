### Notizen:
Morn, born to an elven nobleman and his human mistress, grew up in an elven village deep within the whispering forrest. As a halfblood, he was never accepted. Neither by his family nor by his peers in the village. As such he came to feel insecure about his existence, questioning it day in and day out. One day a bard came to his village and sang a song of great heroes, forever to be remembered in all their glory. While this song was nothing more than that for the people of his village. Morn however felt inspired by those tales of old and so he set out, away from the people who never had come to accept him, to find glory in battle, so that his name too would be carved into history. When he reached the first larger city he became overwhelmed by the cacophony of defening sounds and putrid smells of the town and its people. But amongst the unpleasantness of this city, he didn´t fail to notice the admiring gazes of the townspeople. These gazes, compleatly unkown to his until this point, intoxicated Morn like no drug ever could. Later on the same day he bought his first rapier. He didn´t choose that weapon because of his skills, but because it was the most flamboyant weapon available to him.  
In order to train himself and hone his skills he enlisted in the army of a local lord. Quickly rising the ranks because of this skill with the blade and his elven looks. Eventually filling the position as his lords adjutant. Unfortunatly for the lord, a ploy in the capital left him fallen from grace and eventually imprisoned for crimes he didn´t commit. Seeing this Morn cut his ties and left the sinking ship making money as a fencing instructor for the children of nobles or other wealthy families. He however felt, that these activities didn´t contribute to his glory all that much, so he just up and left after another contract expired.
From that day onward he would only ever strive for personal glory so that one day a bard might sing a song about him. In his quest to fame, he developted a particular liking towards humans, which where quick to shower him with praise. Conversly he developed a distaste for pure-blooded elves, as they never accepted him, no matter how hard he tried.
