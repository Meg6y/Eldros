| Geschlecht:        | female                                  | Aussehen:          | Yukikaze is otherworldly yet approachable, her presence reminiscent of a snowy dawn. Her long, silken hair shimmers like fresh-fallen snow, and her eyes glint with the pale blue of glacial ice. Her kimono, woven from frost and moonlight, trails mist as she walks, leaving a light dusting of snow in her wake. Despite her ethereal beauty, there is warmth in her smile, as though promising that even winter can bring comfort and hope. |

Origins 

Long ago, Yukikaze was born from the first snowflake of a pristine winter—a spirit woven of ice, wind, and the whispers of the northern stars. She was created by the divine forces of nature to embody the serenity and beauty of winter. Unlike other yuki-onna, who are known for their vengeance and icy cruelty, Yukikaze was unique: gentle, nurturing, and kind. She loved the world’s quiet moments, the muffled stillness of snowfall, and the glimmer of frost under moonlight. Her purpose was not to harm but to guide lost travelers, protect winter’s balance, and ensure the season's gifts were cherished rather than feared. 

The Village of Zimagorod 

For centuries, Yukikaze served as an unseen guardian of Zimagorod, a small, remote village nestled high in the snow-capped mountains. The villagers revered her as a winter kami, leaving offerings of bread and honey at shrines to earn her favor. In return, Yukikaze cloaked their lands in blankets of snow, keeping predators at bay and providing fertile meltwater for their crops each spring. Her presence was the heart of their winters, and the village flourished in harmony with the natural cycle of the seasons. 

But one fateful year, the winter never came. The once snow-blanketed village grew bare, the rivers dried to trickles, and the lands became barren. The villagers prayed to Yukikaze for aid, but the spirit of winter could no longer answer. For the first time in centuries, Yukikaze’s connection to her powers had been severed, and the source of winter’s magic had disappeared. 

The Disappearance of Grandfather Winter 

In her search for answers, Yukikaze discovered that the heart of winter itself, the ancient being known as Grandfather Winter, had vanished.
