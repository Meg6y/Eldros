Roleplaying a character with high intelligence but very low charisma, like your superintelligent Rat King, can be a lot of fun! Here’s how to handle this combination effectively:

### Personality and Mannerisms:
- **Arrogance and Dismissiveness**: The Rat King knows he's far smarter than everyone around him, but his low charisma means he lacks any social grace or empathy. He might constantly belittle others, cutting them off mid-sentence or making snide remarks like, "Oh, another brilliant idea from a mammal with half a brain."
- **Obsessive Focus on Logic**: He approaches everything with cold, calculating precision. He can’t relate to emotional arguments or see the value in diplomacy. If someone tries to reason with him emotionally, he’d respond with something like, "Your feelings are irrelevant to the equation."
- **Social Awkwardness**: Despite his genius, he’s terrible at reading social cues. He might interrupt others, dominate conversations, or say things that make others uncomfortable. For example, he might over-explain his plans in excruciating detail without realizing the others have lost interest.
- **Condescending Speech**: He might use overly complex language, not because he's trying to be difficult, but because he genuinely doesn't realize that others can’t follow his train of thought. Phrases like, "It’s elementary. How could anyone not understand the rudimentary concept of inverse dynamics?"

### Motivations and Dialogue:
- **Manipulative but Inept**: His intelligence lets him craft brilliant plans, but his low charisma makes it hard for him to convince others. He could try to manipulate the players or goblins, but it comes off as blunt and patronizing. He could say, "I suppose even *you* could understand the benefits of following my orders."
- **Lack of Charm or Diplomacy**: When offering a deal or trying to get the players on his side, he might struggle to make it sound appealing. Instead of charmingly persuading them, he might say, "I’ll tolerate your help if you don't slow me down. You’re not as dim-witted as the others, are you?"

### Roleplaying Example:
- **Tone**: Dry, matter-of-fact, with a sharp edge of impatience.
- **Body Language**: Avoids eye contact, maybe twitchy or fidgety, focused more on the crown or his surroundings than the people he’s talking to.
- **Conversations**: If the players ask him questions, he might give long-winded explanations that show off his intellect but are hard to follow or just rude.

**Example Interaction**:
- Player: "Why should we help you?"
- Rat King: "Why indeed? Because while you’re fumbling through the muck, I’m the only one here capable of formulating a solution. Help me, or continue wallowing in ignorance—it’s no difference to me, but your lives might depend on the right choice."

### Additional Quirks:
- **Lack of Social Filter**: He could insult people unintentionally or make crude observations. For example, commenting on someone's appearance or capabilities with blunt honesty.
  
- **Avoiding Emotional Conversations**: If anyone tries to appeal to his emotions, he quickly redirects the conversation to something intellectual, uncomfortable with any emotional or empathetic interactions.
